Dashboard, a project by Raftar Formula Racing is an interactive data visualization software.

It presents versatile, powerful analytics dashboard displaying a plethora of graphical interpretations of complex data for examination, optimization and decision making with respect to any iOT device's sensors data, particularly EVs

I built robust data processing pipeline, as shown below, for streaming the data right from IoT sensors to a GUI with proper storage, hosting and querying capabilities. I handled everything on the frontend, backend and database side whilst a friend handled all the iOT streaming and processing part

The database, is a highly scalable, cost effective warehouse to process, maintain and serves data for inspection and exploration.

This project has all the abilities of a high powered web application - authentication, reactive UI, effective state management, simple API server setup, database integrations and complex SQL queries to store, retrieve and process data, error handling, logging and monitoring and redundant production grade deployment and hosting with a custom domain in the cloud.
